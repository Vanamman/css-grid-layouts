# css-grid-layouts

These layouts are simply here for archiving purposes and can be used as a baseline to create a similiar looking website. These layouts will all utilize CSS Grid. Thus I suggest making a working mobile site first and then using media and support queries to input the grid layout. This way if the browser does not support CSS Grid at least you can fallback to your mobile version of the site.


One-Third + Two-Thirds:

This layout uses a header and footer that span the full length of the grid and a sidebar that continues down the left side inside of the header and footer. It also uses cards for the main content with one of the cards taking up two columns and two rows.
